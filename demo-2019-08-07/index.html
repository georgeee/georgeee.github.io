    <h1>Part I</h1>

    <section>
      First demo shows launch of load test experiment with manual launch of every node.

      <br>

      All nodes are launched within a single tmux window:

      <ul>
        <li>central (left) pane: master node</li>
        <li>right-top pane: regular node with signature verification off</li>
        <li>right-bottom pane: regular node with signature verification on</li>
        <li>bottom-left pane: submitter nodes (5 nodes in single pane)</li>
        <li>bottom-right pane: signature verifier nodes (16 nodes in single pane)</li>
      </ul>

      During experiment nodes log recently applied blocks with amount of txs in the block.
      Block is created once per second and amount of txs per block is averages at 12500.

      <br>

      Each of 5 submitters generates a constant flow of 2500 transactions per second.
      <br>
      <br>
      Regular node with signature verification lags behind for the reason that it's impossible
      to verify more than ~8000 transactions per second on a single thread. If we would launch
      signature verfiers for regular node as well, it would remove the lag-behind effect.

      <br>
      <br>
      At the end of experiment some of submitters end up 3-7 seconds earlier than others thus
      for a few last blocks we observe 5000 transactions per block. This degradation happens
      immediately which is an evidence that master node processed all the transactions immediately
      (without visible delay) and didn't accumulate any transactions in a buffer.

    <h1>Part II</h1>

    <section>
      This is a short demo which shows use of load test tool `ltt` to measure performance
      of the node locally.
      <br>
      Experiment is launched for 30 seconds with 5 submitters each producing 3600tps.

    <h1>Part III</h1>

    <section>
      This is a short demo which shows use of load test tool `ltt` to measure performance
      of the node locally.
      <br>
      Experiment is launched for 30 seconds with 5 submitters each producing 2000tps of
      regular transaction flow and 100 tps of payment channel commitment transactions.

      <br> 
      <br>

      After commitment, each payment channel is active for 4s and handles 11
      microtransactions internally. Activity on payment channels is emulated
      by creating, signing and sending microtransactions from submitter with index <i>i</i>
      to submitter with index <i>i+1</i> (where <i>i</i> is the index of a submitter
      that created a commitment transaction for the channel).

      <br>
      <br>

      Note that due to payment channels, 100 commitment transactions per second per submitter
      result into additional 4650 tps as a result of the experiment.

    <h1>Part IV</h1>

    <section>
      This is a short demo which shows use of load test tool `ltt` to measure performance
      of the node locally.
      <br>
      Experiment is launched for 30 seconds with 5 submitters each producing 
      100 tps of payment channel commitment transactions.

      <br> 
      <br>

      After commitment, each payment channel is active for 4s and handles 100
      microtransactions internally. Activity on payment channels is emulated
      by creating, signing and sending microtransactions from submitter with index <i>i</i>
      to submitter with index <i>i+1</i> (where <i>i</i> is the index of a submitter
      that created a commitment transaction for the channel).

      <br>
      <br>
      Note that due to payment channels, 100 commitment transactions per second per submitter
      result into additional 46353 tps total. This is just slightly less than target
      50000 tps.
      <br>
      <br>
      Note that the bottleneck here is how much microtransactions submitters are able to handle,
      node can surely handle 9000 commitment/withdrawal transactions per second which is evidenced
      by Part I and Part II.
